# Typeaholic
Typeaholic is a web-based typing game built with React, Vite, and Shadcn to help you improve your typing speed and accuracy. Inspired by popular tools like Monkeytype and 10FastFingers, it offers various game modes to cater to different learning styles.

## Features
- Four game modes:
    - **Timed**: Race against the clock and type as many words as possible within the chosen time limit.
    - **Infinite**: Practice typing endlessly with real-time WPM (Words Per Minute) calculation.
    - **Perfection**: Similar to Timed, but you can't move on to the next word until it's typed flawlessly.
    - **Survival**: A fast-paced mode where the first line disappears every 20 seconds, increasing in speed with each line lost. Survive for as long as you can!
- Internationalization: Choose between Portuguese, English and Spanish.
- Theme: Light and Dark mode
